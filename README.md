# World_Weather_Analysis

## Purpose and Overview

The purpose of this project was to work with importing APIs into a Jupyter Notebook
and using information from them to create graphs, charts, and interactive maps.
In this instance, I imported both Open Weather's and Google Maps' APIs, and created
statistical charts based on weather data, an interactive heat map with map markers, 
a map of cities with a nearby hotel with map markers, and finally a travel map
showing routes from 4 different cities in the northeastern region of the US.
